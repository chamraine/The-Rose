# The Rose

The Rose is a South Korean pop rock band formerly under J&Star Company. Through this website, site users who are fans or potential fans are able to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and possibly purchase merchandises or tickets for concerts.

### User stories:

1.  As a fan of The Rose, I wish to show my support for them by dedicating this website for them. This would also help them be more recognised in the music industry as they are not very popular.

2.  As for newer fan of The Rose, through this website they get to understand and know more about the members. They would be more curious and check them out on their social media accounts.

3.  As a person who enjoys listening to The Rose's music, I wish to listen to their latest release music and find more songs that I would enjoy listening.

### Goal of Website Owner:

1. The website helps to promote The Rose which in turn helps to gain more Korea or International fans.
2. By promoting, it would increase their fanbase and thus fans would be more likely to spend money on The Rose's merchandises.
3. Show support for The Rose, members would then make more music for fans to enjoy
